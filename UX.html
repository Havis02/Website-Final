            Throughout the journey of creating and designing this website and its contents, I hope to have made both my thoughts regarding scope and strategy obvious to those who explore my website. The audience in which I evidently hope to cater for are my professors (both Mary Jackson and Mic Palmer), my possible future employers, classmates, family members and friends. This will be seen and achieved through appealing to their needs of a well-functioning and useable website: one that is simple to navigate, aesthetically pleasing to the eye and easy to both read and understand even without the background knowledge of the course that both myself and my professors would harbour. Having a pleasing aesthetic, although not top priority for someone like me who has never made a website before, is incredibly important for the overall success of ones website as this could be a selling point for a visitor to advertise the site or even give them cause to return back at another time. I also had to think deeply about what I wish to achieve from making this website, besides the obvious desire to obtain a good mark from the hard work that I have put into making this website and its contents, I also want my website to be useable and not complicated to operate as that would cause it to become a good piece for my portfolio which could be used to hopefully impress my future employers and give me a skill that others applying for the job might not have. I also want this website to gain me some feedback that will allow me to learn and continue to expand my knowledge on the course in its entirety and on this module, especially as I am aware that my website will not be perfect, as someone who has never coded in HTML before this I hope to show that I have successfully stepped out of my comfort zone and to project to my audience that 100% of my efforts have been put into creating this website.

        <p id="para2">
            In order to achieve all that I previously stated, I need to know what my website needs to include to gain my desired success. For example, I know that to gain respectable marks my website will need to showcase all the tasks in which we have covered throughout this module and its lectures. This includes: the CARP posters, the typography task of the 8 different typographical systems, the weekly Coding tasks, this UX task and my overall review of the project. As well as this, I had to think about the other audiences that I am hoping to impress while looking through my website, one of the main ones being: possible future employers. Therefore, I decided to cater to them through the inclusion of an ‘About Me’ section below the fold of my home page which I hope will allow an insight into me and who I am, this will also include my CV and contact information along with a link to my Instagram page where I can showcase the edits that I make in Adobe After Effects, a skill that would hopefully place me above other possible employees. There are also many functional needs that my website should include to both work correctly and please my audience such as a navigation bar, images, links and responsive to multiple different screen types, all in which I hope to include within my website. I also hope that by making my website out of multiple pages that it would help my audience feel instantly familiar and comfortable with navigating around the pages as it would resemble any other website that they had already used.
