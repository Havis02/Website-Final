            Throughout the process of completing this module I made sure to continuously stay on target for my desired audience of Mary Jackson (my professor) and even possible future employers. In order to do this, I kept my website organised and not too information heavy with the necessary tasks needed for the assignment being easy to find and well displayed on every page. I also attempted to make my website aesthetically pleasing to anyone who may want to look at it, my choice of a ‘sunset’ palette hopefully making the viewer feel calm while looking through all the pages, as well as this the titles on every page matching will hopefully bring an air of comfort to my audience due to the relaxing connotations of repetition. In order to appeal to possible future employers I also included an ‘About Me’ section on my homepage, a place where they can access my CV, portfolio, and a link to my Instagram page where they could see my edits.

            Overall, I feel as though I found the majority of this module fun and manageable due to the creative and illustrative elements to each task, by all means, this does not mean that I found this module easy, the sheer volume of tasks was a lot for me to handle but being able to use software’s like Adobe Illustrator that I am familiar with gave me a sense of strength and security throughout completing the module. The task that I enjoyed the most being the typography or CARP tasks, due to me being able to showcase my creativity with limited restrictions.

            Through the module, I believe that I struggled the most with the coding task and the overall coding of the website, this is because I had never done it before. Attempting to learn all the vocabulary and systems behind HTML and CSS proved harder than I could have thought, each page I coded brought me a new challenge that I had to somehow overcome in order to move on with my websites. However, through the use of the internet and my lecturers, I was able to beat the difficulties I faced and give you the website you are reading this on right now.

            I can easily say that I have in fact learnt an abundance of new skills throughout this module; not just the introduction into HTML coding and CSS but also how to use the Adobe software ‘InDesign’, as I found this to be quite different to my prior experiences with Illustrator. I also feel as though I learnt how to manage my time more, each element of this assignment taking up a lot of my time helped to me find motivation to finish each task to the best of my ability. Now having reached the other side of the module, I can see that there was little I would have done different, each task providing me with new skills to learn and my development of time management also helped to channel my stress productively. However, I do feel as though I would have benefitted from being less fearful of failure as then I would have asked more questions and probably finished some tasks quicker.
