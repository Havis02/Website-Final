        My Reflection:
        Over the duration of designing these posters I was able to thoroughly explore multiple different mediums and poster design styles, developing an interest in both minimalism and illustrations as evident from my three poster designs laid out on this page. My final and most refined design showing you my liking for minimalism through the almost greyscale looking colour palette of the poster that contrasts with the bright red colours of the ‘Instagram tags’ placed upon the images and with the red of the logo too. The images I carefully selected all are originally from the True/ False website, all of which showcase past award winners film stills, all of which complement each other due to their similar colour schemes. The other two posters I made to demonstrate my skills in illustrations using adobe software’s, the film stripes being crafted from multiple different shapes as well as the film camera in the poster below also being created with different shapes. My main reason for this method was so that my posters would be completely original and my own. Throughout this process, I created many a different plan regarding each poster, many of which were angrily discarded with quite a lot of motivation being lost along with it, however, once Id finally decided on the plans I wished to execute I was able to muster up the adrenaline to make them. This is when a whole new challenge arose, Adobe InDesign. This software, despite its similarities to Adobe Illustrator, proved to be a hurdle to overcome; after watching many tutorials and asking my peers way to many questions regarding such simple things like how to scale an image or shape, I was able to reach the point where I was happy with the posters I had created. This was then the point when I took my designs to show my professor, this then opened the door to all new improvements that I had to undertake on my main poster, these included changing the colour of the Instagram tags to red instead of black and also including the tagline of information at the bottom of the page aligned with the website link. The overall experience of designing these posters was definitely harder than I though they would be, as someone who has previous experience with Adobe Illustrator I believed that making these posters would be one of the simpler tasks of the module however there were many problems in which I had to face over the cause of completing the task.
