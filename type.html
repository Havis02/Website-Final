               The main premiss of this typography style is that the text follows along an imaginary line, the texts only strict rule being to follow. This means that the text can be aligned either side and even that the line does not have to be vertical. The way I achieved this is through creating multiple diagonal lines and arranging them into a zigzag pattern, my aim to ultimately make a possibly boring or plain looking typographic system into something more unique.

                A neat and mathematical way to layout ones typography. With the use of this technique all the text and graphics should fit neatly into columns and rows. This is a well-used layout simply due to the fact that there is guaranteed readability. For my example, I used a more broken grid to create a more abstract interpretation along with the use of coloured squares that break away from the traditional grid layout rules.

                This typographical system layout picks a central focal point and arranges all text and information as through it is immerging out from said point. This can however cause the text to be positioned in awkward and hard to read ways such as upside down or horizontal. The way I positioned mine to try and avoid this issue was through making the text come out of the circle to the sides, making it easy to read as it is positioned the same way a bool would be (reading left to right).

    <div class="typedil" id="typedil">

                Although not the most attractive nor productive typography out there, this system is known for its text being set along a circular pathway, the text forming curves (most commonly circles) around a point. This design style is proven risky to use as it is difficult to read due to the natural bends of a circle leading to some text being presented upside down. There is also the problem, that to many the circles of text could look displeasing and ultimately not aesthetic to the onlooker. This design is best suited for posters and for small blocks of text, this is why it works well within my design, the limited amount of information allowing for the circles to not have to be complete and therefore can be rotated and positioned so that the reader can read the text with greater ease.

    <div class="typetrans" id="typetrans">

        <div class="transtext">
            <p id="typetit">
                Transitional:
             </p>
            <p>
                This system is definitely known to be one of the more artistic designs, the ‘waved’ and curved lines layering on top of one another to build up an image that is almost river-like in the way that the text flows through the page. One could also resemble this style with the appearance of stone, causing such a design to appeal to a mass audience due to the aesthetics connoted by the layering of the text. This design is surprisingly most commonly seen on book covers as though to set up the mood and peaceful atmosphere for the contents of the book itself. I hoped to depict a similar feeling with my design example through not only the layering of the text but also through the layering of the different shades of purple as though to resemble mountains.

    <div class="typebil" id="typebil">
        <img src="images/Bilateral.png" width="500" height="500" style=

        <div class="biltext">

                Bilateral:
            </p>
            <p>
                Also referred to as ‘centred’, which should give insight into how this system should appear to its viewers. This typographical system have adopted the bad reputation of being boring and unimaginative due to the fact that the text is often written all the same way as well as all being aligned with each other; making it all look the same. This system is always symmetrical but can vary slightly through the use of vertical and horizontal space. I hoped to increase viewer intrigue slightly with my design interpretation of the bilateral system through my use of the colour purple and also through the use of lines that emerge from both the tops and bottom of each section of text.

               Repetition of structures to put this system into its simplest form, this can be the repetition of anything within the design: a shape, text, style, structure etc. This system is often used to break up content, the repetition giving viewers something familiar to look at throughout the design, hence the common use of repetition in many designs. I hope to portray this through my design, the repetition of the square hoping to have the appearance of post-it notes due to the use of ‘drop shadow’ on each one. These ‘post-its’ all containing the needed information for the design but causing it to appear more friendly through it being broken up into nicer to read chunks compared to a block of text.

                Random:
            </p>
            <p>
                This system is exactly how it is described: random. With no real order to this system, the text and shapes can be seen as ‘all over the place’ to many viewers, such a trait ultimately making it had to read and interpret which is definitely not ideal to many designers as it would instantly make their work unappealing. There is not much strategy to this system as it is ‘random’, the more jumbled the better. My design used not only randomness of text but also of text weight and style as well as interspersing some colour on some of the text.
